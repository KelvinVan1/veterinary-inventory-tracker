Inventory Tracker/Management Software

The Veterinary Inventory Tracker is an application that helps track current supply/inventory in a easy to use GUI

NOTE: This branch is constantly changing as I am in the process of rewriting the entire codebase in order to clean up a lot of the code as well as make it more efficient overall. If you are looking for a working branch please be directed back towards main. Rewrite will have pushes and commits often as I work on refactoring the codebase however this will take some time and it may not work or may be missing features as work has just started on this. Once I am comfortable with having basic features created then this will be merged into dev and work will be continued on the dev branch. Thank you for your understanding ~Kelvin 2/5/2023
